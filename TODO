Structure:
/- Where to put added libraries (in libs/, external/, extras/, or some other folder)
/- Where to put compiled library files (.a and .o) in libs/ or bin/
/- Consider moving folders from in src/ to project root (to look the same as Visual Studio Projects), 
/  And if so, where to put binary files, in bin/ at project root or per project folder.
/- Copy folder structure for include/ directory, and make it work with CMake,  
/   Or remove the structure for include and src entirely

Documentation/Doxygen:
- Get PDF working
- Get main page looking better
/- Create INSTALL file

Testing:
- Whether to use CTest, GoogleTest, Unit-Tests, or some other framework
- Prefer to write tests in C as well, but not necessarily
- Consider dropping the testing library in favor of running tests directly from CMake
- Where to put tests, in tests/ folder or put tests as close to source file

CMake:
- Change finding all sources from GLOB to target_sources
- Figure out how to change folder for different architecture and build modes
/- Generate documentation in CMake
- Run Tests from CMake
- Consider making a scripts folder to hold a bash script to run CMake with proper configuration
/- Look into using install instead of moving the binaries

Git/GitHub:
/- Consider making each module a different git repository

Open Source:
- Contributing file
- Bug reports file

Extras:
- Get Project Logo
- Figure out what TRAVIS.yml is
- Use .editorconfig for consistancy
- Configure .gitattributes futher
